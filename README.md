littlecompiler
======================

Graduate project to create a compiler for a simple programming language called "Little".  This repository contains code for the "Little" compiler.  The compiled code reads in source code files with a ".lit" extension, parses and generates byte code for the program, and executes the "Little" source code commands.  The project was part of a graduate-level CS class.
